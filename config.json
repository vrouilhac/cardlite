    "a": "Signed integers means that one bit will be used to decide wether or not the number is positive or negative to represent numbers such as 123 or -3223. Unsigned means that the number is positive, therefor no bit is used for the sign which means that unsigned integers can store larger number than signed integers for the same amount of bit usage."
